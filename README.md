## Features

- Briefly list the main features of your application:
  - RESTful API endpoints for data management
  - User authentication and authorization
  - Real-time data updates with WebSockets
  - Logging and monitoring support

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Other**: Docker, GitHub Actions for CI/CD, Gitpod for online development

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version >= 14)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (or use a cloud MongoDB instance)
- Docker (optional for containerized setup)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
   cd repo-name
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

```plaintext
PORT=8000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-db-name
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

> **Note**: Make sure to update `MONGODB_URI` with the correct database connection string.

### Running the Application

To start the server, use:

```bash
npm start
```

or, if you want to use `nodemon` for hot-reloading during development:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Gitpod Setup

Gitpod provides a ready-to-code environment in the cloud, ideal for development and contribution.

1. Click the button below to open the project in Gitpod:

   [![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/username/repo-name)

2. Once Gitpod starts, it will automatically install dependencies and set up the project based on the `.gitpod.yml` file in the repository.

3. Update the `.gitpod.yml` file to include any specific environment variables or additional setup commands you need. Hereâ€™s an example:

   ```yaml
   tasks:
     - init: npm install
       command: npm run dev
   ports:
     - port: 8000
       onOpen: open-preview
   ```

   This configuration ensures that the development server starts automatically and the preview opens on port 8000.

## Testing

This project includes unit and integration tests. To run the tests, use:

```bash
npm test
```

Or, to run tests with live reloading during development:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

### Linting and Formatting

For code consistency, run linting before each commit:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run format
```

## API Documentation

You can test and explore API endpoints using tools like Postman or cURL. Below is a sample API request:

**Example Request**: `POST /api/logs`

```json
{
  "accessTime": "2023-11-13 10:00:00",
  "user": "John Doe",
  "action": "Logged in"
}
```

For detailed API documentation, refer to `docs/api-docs.md`.
